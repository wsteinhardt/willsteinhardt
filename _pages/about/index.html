My research involves developing scaled-down laboratory systems to try to study these problems and developing and utilizing multi-dimensional field and laboratory measurements to better connect these analog systems to nature. I am especially interested in exploring the role of heterogeneity in determining the dynamics, complexity and roughness of both faults and fractures, as well as problems related to damage, wear, and granular dynamics.</p> </body></html>
